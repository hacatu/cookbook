			<h1>A Definitely Objective Discussion of Burgers</h1>
			<div class="tsect_inline">
				As a lifelong amateur (that's right, nobody pays me to do this ðŸ˜Ž) vegetarian, I've tried quite a lot of veggie burgers.
				They're a versatile subset of the sandwitch family that are both a staple of vegetarian eating and distinct and enjoyable
				enough to be preferrable to traditional burgers even to non-vegetarians.
				<p>
				Also like traditional burgers though, veggie burgers exist on a long spectrum from life-alteringly delicious to unpalatable cardboard.
				Herein I hope to expose some of the baddies for being ... bad, while introducing some truly powerful heros in the veggie burger
				culinary universe.
				I hope you enjoy the journey!

				<h3>Frozen Burgers: Instant Gratification (or not)</h3>
				Most frozen veggie burgers suffer from an affliction of not being very good.
				Even a cursory visual inspection will reveal the ingredients were forced together under tremendous pressure against their will,
				and that the entire agglomeration has not weathered the freezing process very enviably.
				They tend to resemble a curious cross between cardboard, rock, and rubber in their flavor, hardness, and unappetizing bounce when
				bent or tossed on a pan.
				Finally, they usually do not have an appreciable difference between the surface and interior.
				<p>
				Burgers which buck these trends can be quite good.
				If the burger
				<ul>
					<li>has a distinguishable outer crust,</li>
					<li>can be crumbled before cooking, or can actually be pressed down leaving an indentation,</li>
					<li>wasn't entirely cooked before freezing,</li>
					<li>doesn't have a bunch of beans or vegetables that are not chopped small enough or cooked long enough,</li>
					<li>and has good seasonings instead of being underflavored or trying to emulate meat burgers,</li>
				</ul>
				then it has a pretty good chance of actually being good.
				</p>
				<p>
				I've had plenty of different kinds that were disgusting due to rubbery texture or poor flavors;
				it isn't worth calling them out.
				</p>
				<p>
				I will however take this time to call out the Impossible burger and Beyond burger.
				They are disgusting and terrible.
				Curously they manage to have a texture which is both rubbery and, I'm told, a very effective imitation of actual meat.
				I also find the flavor to be abhorrent, quite possibly because is is their aim to taste as much like meat as possible.
				As such they don't have good seasonings and I view and deride them in much the same way a McDonalds afficionado might
				talk smack about raw tofu, because the argument could be made that neither is supposed to be eaten on its own without
				seasonings.
				One of the biggest strengths of veggie burgers is that they can incorporate a lot of varied ingredients and seasonings
				in order to have strong flavors on their own, so I consider this a deep failing on the part of these imitation meats
				and don't see any use for them.
				Someone who enjoys meat and wants something which tastes like meat should consider eating meat, and someone who wants
				to eat these imitation meats for health reasons should consider at least trying other options which might not be what
				they're used to but offer a breadth of choices vastly eclipsing traditional burgers.
				</p>
				<p>
				But do not lose hope beloved reader!
				Although there are a great many options when it comes to frozen veggie burgers which do not spark joy,
				those who wish to have a pleasant dining experience are not wholly without recourse when it comes to these long keeping,
				easy and quick to prepare options.
				</p>
				<p>
				The best frozen veggie burgers I've tried are Trader Joe's Cowboy Quinoa Burgers, which avoid all the pitfalls listed on
				my above bad burger checklist and are extremely enjoyable with ketchup, hummus, or even just cheese.
				Their Veggie Masala Burgers are also quite good.
				For those not blessed to live close to a Trader Joe's, I unfortunately don't know any good options off the top of my head.
				</p>

				<h3>Restaurant Quality</h3>
				Many restaurants have tried their hand at providing one or more veggie burger options.
				A disappointingly large number simply serve frozen burgers (though they do tend to at least cook them for you),
				in many cases this is the Impossible and/or Beyond burger in particular and they find it something worth flaunting.
				<p>
				Out of the burgers that are actually made in house that I've had, most were black bean burgers, often black bean sweet
				potato burgers.  Many of these were quite good.
				</p>
				<p>
				Some interesting exceptions I've had include
				<ul>
					<li>
						Red Bean Quinoa burgers: these were extremely good.  Both red beans (kidney beans) and quinoa have a "watery"
						quality to them, but also lend themselves easily to whatever other flavors you decide to introduce.
						Red beans also act effectively as a binding agent, which we'll see more about in the recipes section.
					</li>
					<li>
						Chickpea burgers with blue cheese sauce:  I'm a certified blue cheese fiend so you better believe I enjoyed these.
						Chickpea burgers themselves are kind of similar to falafel (which is also made from chickpeas) but flat instead of
						spherical, baked instead of fried, with larger pieces of chickpea, and soft with a crunchy shell instead of chewy throughout.
						Then of course the blue cheese sauce is a departure from the normal falafel sauce composed of tahini or hummus,
						as well as more traditional burger sauces such as ketchup, BBQ sauce, or guacamole.
					</li>
					<li>
						Pulled Jackfruit burgers:  I've had a variation of this at several places and it's consistently very good.
						It's usually modelled after pulled pork and seasoned with BBQ sauce or otherwise spicy.
						Jackfruit itself is absolutely insane.
						There are quite a few fruits that can be used very effectively in cooking, including pineapple,
						apple, apricots, oranges, lemons, limes, coconut,
						and kind of plantains and sweet potatoes although these aren't fruits just sweet vegetables.
						Jackfruit completely unlike all of these though.
						As soon as you open a can of jackfruit, cut open a fresh one, or look at a dish made out of it, it looks like
						meat.
						It is slightly sweet, but after cooking and seasoning it this is totally masked.
					</li>
					<li>
						Mushroom burgers: this is the second most common kind of in house veggie burgers you'll tend to find at restaurants.
						They often also include black beans since while mushrooms serve as an effective replacement for the role of meat in recipes,
						they do not have much protein at all.
						You'll often even be able to spot the gill like fins of a portabello in these burgers.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
				Probably the best veggie burger I've had from a restaurant is the "Deluxe Burger" from Veganized near Rutgers.
				It's a portabello mushroom and black bean based burger served with carmelized onion, tomato, pickles, and cashew cheese.
				Their cashew cheese isn't like most vegan cheeses though, it's actually good, which is certainly something that sets it apart.
				It's closer to sour cream, but much more tangy.

				<h3>Breakdown and Comparison of Recipes: From Scratch</h3>
				And burgers from other cookbooks (Spicy BBQ Jackfruit Sandwitches with Grilled Pineapple and Pizza Burgers from Minimalist Baker's Everyday Cooking
				are my favorites, with another close contender being <a href="https://happyhealthymama.com/sweet-potato-black-bean-burgers.html">these sweet potato black bean burgers</a>).
