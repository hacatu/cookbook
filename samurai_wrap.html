			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<div class="instructions_holder">
				<ol>
					<li>
						Preheat the oven to 400 ¬∞F.
					</li>
					<li>
						Place the tofu in a tofu press and continually tighten it as you proceed with the rest of the recipe until it is needed.
						If you don't have a tofu press, you can simply press it between two plates with something heavy on top.
						This is not strictly necessary but will improve the tofu.
					</li>
					<li>
						Either peel or wash the sweet potatoes and then cut them into wedges/spears.
						These should be pretty thick, after cutting the sweet potatoes into quarters radially
						lengthwise, each quarter should be cut into about 4 spears lengthwise depending on
						how big the sweet potatoes are.
						If you opt to leave the skin on, soak them for 10-20 minutes before cutting.
					</li>
					<li>
						Place the sweet potato spears on a foil-lined baking tray and bake them for 15-30 minutes.
						Check them every 5 minutes after 15.
						They should be fully cooked so that a fork can easily pierce them, but they should not be cooked
						so much that they become soft (if we wanted that we would boil them or bake them whole at a higher temperature).
					</li>
					<li>
						Wash and shred the kale.
						You can use a knife, but I find it's faster and easier to do it by hand.
						You can also buy kale that's already washed and shredded.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add oil and pressed garlic to a large pot and begin heating it on a stove.
						If you do not have a garlic press, get one.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add the kale to the pot and add a few Tbsp of water.
						Cover and cook for 5+ minutes, removing the lid periodically to toss the kale.
						It should be soft and dark green when done, but don't overdo it or it will be limp and bitter.
					</li>
					<li>
						Mix the oil and spices for the tofu (oil, vinegar, garlic powder, onion powder, liquid smoke),
						put the infused oil in a pan, and heat it up.
					</li>
					<li>
						Cut the tofu into long thin strips and fry them.
						This will probably take at least 5 minutes on both sides, but it depends on your pan and stove.
						The tofu should be beginning to brown but not blackened or overdone.
						The infused oil is fairly dark so it can be hard to tell.
						I simply use a fork to flip the tofu.
					</li>
					<li>
						Wash and cut the mushrooms into long thin strips.
						I wouldn't use pre-sliced mushrooms for this unless you can find them cut into spears.
					</li>
					<li>
						Once the tofu is done, remove it from the pan and fry the mushrooms.
						This should take much less time, probably about 2 minutes per side.
					</li>
					<li>
						Mix the ingredients in the sauce together.
					</li>
					<li>
						Whenever the sweet potato spears are done, remember to turn off the oven!
					</li>
					<li>
						Heat up the tortillas using a pan or microwave.
						If using the same pan you used to fry the tofu and mushrooms, rinse it first.
					</li>
					<li>
						You may now put sweet potato spears, tofu, mushrooms, kale, and a healthy dose of sauce
						on your tortilla and enjoy!
					</li>
