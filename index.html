			<h1>Recipe Index</h1>
			<div class="tsect_inline">
				Here you will find some good recipes I created after many years of study, perilous adventures in flavor, epiphanies in dreams, and so on.
				These recipes are mostly simple, but contain powerful knowledge.
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class="tsect_inline">
				<h3><a href="plantain_mushroom_burgz.html">Plantain Mushroom Burgers with Sweet Potato Fries</a></h3>
				The greatest veggie burger I've ever had, even exceeds restaurant quality.
				Plantains, Portabello mushrooms, black beans, and breadcrumbs, seasoned with red pepper and thyme, and topped with
				Cajun sweet potato fries.
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class="tsect_inline">
				<h3><a href="spicy_korean_mushroom_soup.html">Spicy Korean Mushroom Soup</a></h3>
				This is based on a soup of the same name I got once from a grocery store.
				It's absolutely packed with mushrooms and primarily seasoned with scallions, lemongrass, hatch chilis, and red pepper.
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class="tsect_inline">
				<h3><a href="pizza_soup.html">Pizza Soup</a></h3>
				Another attempt to copy a soup from the above restaraunt.
				Actually vegan unless you choose to add parmesan cheese.
				Includes tons of roasted garlic, plus tomatoes, mushrooms, and some veggies.
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class="tsect_inline">
				<h3><a href="samurai_wrap.html">Samurai Wrap</a></h3>
				After trying every item on the menu (besides the drink and brunch menus) at Veganized, the Samurai was my favorite for a long time.
				<p>
				It's a wrap consisting of tofu, kale, sweet potato, and mushrooms, with a smokey miso sauce.
				The latter three are all top tier foods that fill their roll pretty much optimally.
				Kale is the best leafy vegetable, sweet potato the best solid vegetable, and mushrooms the best "meat substitute".
				The Samurai then slaps a unique, creative, and excellent flavored sauce on this killer combination, adds tofu to make sure you really
				get the sauce, adds absolutely no nonsense, and wraps the whole thing in a tortilla to physically hold it together more effectively than a salad or sandwitch.
				</p>
				<p>
				It's just incredible, I mean, whoever designed this thing is some kind of culinary savant.
				Everything goes together so perfectly I'm just amazed.
				I've never been able to get the sauce exactly right, but I've been steadily improving it and I recently cracked the secret to making
				really good sweet potato wedges.
