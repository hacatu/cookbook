				<h3>Vamp</h3>
				Just like DiGeorno, except completelty different.
				<br>
				After trying the original version of this soup again, I'm now certain it's supposed to include cashew sour cream, so I recommend adding that.
				<br>
				To make a simple cashew sour cream:
				<ol>
					<li> Soak a cup of cashews (ideally bulk chopped cashews as they are less expensive) in water overnight, or in boiling water for 30-60 minutes</li>
					<li> Drain the cashews, put in a blender</li>
					<li> Add <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup water, 2 tsp apple cider vinegar, 1 tsp lemon juice, and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> tsp salt</li>
					<li> Will it blend?  Yes, right now, adding a little more water if needed.  If it's too watery, maybe add a bit of breadcrumbs.</li>
				</ol>

			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<div class="instructions_holder">
				<ol>
					<li>
						Preheat the oven to 425-450 ¬∞F.
					</li>
					<li>
						Peel garlic like your life depends on it.
						I recommend buying bags of pre-peeled garlic, because, really, two heads of garlic is low-balling.
						Some instructions recommend roasting heads of garlic basically whole.  This is not the way.
					</li>
					<li>
						Cover a baking tray with a baking sheet/wax paper/aluminium foil.
						Then cover with a bit of oil, and put on the garlic cloves.
					</li>
					<li>
						Bake the garlic for 15-30 minutes.
						I haven't worked out the best time yet, so check it every so often.
						The cloves should be soft and have some charring on the bottom side, but not be totally burnt.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add the broth and/or water to a large pot and start it boiling at high heat.
						I recommend using at least 4 C of broth, and add 4+ C of water as needed.
					</li>
					<li>
						Chop the onion and wash and chop the carrots and add them to the broth.
						Cook for about 5 minutes.
					</li>
					<li>
						Wash and chop the celery and leek and add them.
					</li>
					<li>
						Wash and chop up both kinds of mushrooms and add them to the pot at the same time.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add more broth/water as needed.
						Once the broth is almost boiling you can lower the heat, but make sure to raise and lower it again as
						needed when adding ingredients.
						Keep the pot covered when not adding ingredients.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add the tomatoes, washed and chopped peppers, and marinara sauce.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add the spices and vinergar and cook for about 15 minutes.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add the roasted garlic and cook for about 10 more minutes.
					</li>
					<li>
						Remove the soup from the heat, let cool, and enjoy.
						You can add additional spices (salt/pepper/italian seasoning/garlic powder/red pepper flakes/parmesan cheese/vinegar) to taste.
					</li>
