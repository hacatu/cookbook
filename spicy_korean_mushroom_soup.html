			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<div class="instructions_holder">
				<ol>
					<li>
						Add the broth and/or water to a large pot and start it boiling at high heat.
						I recommend using at least 4 C of broth, and then adding boiling water from
						an electric kettle after you add the chopped mushrooms, as necessary to cover them.
					</li>
					<li>
						Wash and chop up both kinds of mushrooms and add them to the pot at the same time.
						You can also simply use pre-chopped mushrooms, about 1 container of each portabello and shiitake is good.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add more broth/water as needed.
						Once the broth is almost boiling you can lower the heat, but make sure to raise and lower it again as
						needed when adding ingredients.
						Keep the pot covered when not adding ingredients.
					</li>
					<li>
						Wash and chop the lemongrass and add it.
						Lemongrass is like very hard mini scallions, so it is important to add it early or it will be unpleasantly crunchy.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add the hatch chili pepper.
						This is similar to bay leaves: it goes in the soup while cooking but should be removed at the end.
						You may wish to put it inside a cheesecloth or strainer ball but it isn't necessary.
					</li>
					<li>
						Wash and chop the scallions and add them.
						You should throw out a bit at the bulb end and a bit more at the other end, cutting off a lot of the leafy parts.
					</li>
					<li>
						Wash and shred the bok choi and add it.
						You can cut it with a knife, but I usually just rip up bok choi and kale with my hands because it is faster.
					</li>
					<li>
						The soup should cook for 30 minutes from this point, or possibly a bit longer.
						Remember to stir it periodically and modulate the heat to keep it hot but not boiling.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add the other spices.
					</li>
					<li>
						8-13 minutes before serving (so about 20 minutes after adding the bok choi), add the noodles.
						Cooking noodles in the same pot as soup or rice is a good way to save water and pans and give
						the noodles more flavor.
						You will sometimes need to increase the cooking time slightly though, so make sure to check them with
						a fork.
					</li>
					<li>
						Remove the soup from the heat, take out the hatch chili, and let cool.
					</li>
