				<h3>Vamp</h3>
				I've probably eaten over a hundred veggie burgers of several dozen varieties over the years, so when I say that this is the best one I've ever tried,
				understand that that endorsement comes with a lot of weight.
				<p>
				I could write an entire article just comparing different kinds of veggie burgers, and actually, <a href="burgz.html">I did</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
				Black bean burgers are a staple recipe.
				Putting sweet potato fries on a burger is a cheat code to elevate it up to the next level.
				It works well enough with decent frozen burgers and fries, or especially good quality burgers and fries from a restaurant,
				but this recipe takes it to the next level.
				</p>
				<p>
				The only potential downside to putting sweet potato fries on a burger is that it removes the ability to use sweet potato as a component of the burgers themselves.
				But in this recipe, I turn that into a strength by instead adding plantains, mushrooms, and breadcrumbs to the mix.
				Plantains give the burger a unique sweet flavor and help bind it together, while the mushrooms and breadcrumbs
				enhance the savory flavor profile with their own tastes and by sponging up the seasonings.

			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<div class="instructions_holder">
				<ol>
					<li>
						Preheat the oven to 425 ¬∞F.
					</li>
					<li>
						Peel and cut the plantains, cut and wash the mushrooms, and cut the onion.
						Set these aside.
					</li>
					<li>
						Wash and optionally soak the sweet potatoes, then cut them up.
						Do not remove the skin.
						The potatoes should be cut into long thin strips.
						First, cut each into quarters radially around the long axis.
						Next, slice each quarter into thin layers longways.
						Finally, cut the wide layers longways again into strips as needed.
						I recommend using 4 sweet potatoes.
						The fries are fantastic on the burgers but also on their own so you will want a lot.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add 2 Tbsp oil and the spices for the sweet potato fries
							(salt, garlic powder, smoked paprika, oregano, thyme, black pepper, cayanne)
							to a small bowl and mix.
					</li>
					<li>
						Lay out the sweet potato strips on foil on one or more baking trays.
						Coat the strips with the spice mixture.
						I recommend using a spoon to get it roughly distributed and then a brush to even it out.
					</li>
					<li>
						Bake the sweet potato strips for 15 minutes.
						Then place the trays on a stove or cooling rack, flip the fries using a metal spatula, and bake for 15 minutes on the other side.
					</li>
					<li>
						Once the sweet potato fries are done, you may turn off the oven or use it to bake something else (kale chips, muffins, biscuits, potatoes, etc).
						While the fries cook, proceed with the burger preparation.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add a thick layer of oil to a pan and heat it up, to fry the plantains.
						The layer should be thick enough that the plantain slices break the surface tension (at least <sup>1</sup>‚ÅÑ<sub>16</sub> in).
					</li>
					<li>
						Once the oil is hot, fry the the plantains for about 5 minutes on each side.
						The plantain slices should end up soft when you are done.
						This could take more than 5 minutes.
						If the plantain slices aren't cooked enough, the burgers will be dry and not hold together as well.
						You can simply use 3 eggs to compensate if the plantain slices are too dry after frying.
					</li>
					<li>
						Let the plantains cool on a paper towel to collect excess oil.
					</li>
					<li>
						Fry the mushrooms in the same pan.
						Since it is already hot, this will be very fast, possibly only 2 minutes.
					</li>
					<li>
						Place the fried plantains in bowl and mash them with a spoon.
						If they are too dry, it may be easier to break them up with your hands.
					</li>
					<li>
						Dump the mashed plantains and fried mushrooms into another bowl.
					</li>
					<li>
						Take the beans out of the can, wash and drain them, then mash them and add them to the same bowl.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add 2-3 eggs, depending on how dry the plantains were.
						Mix.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add the breadcrumbs.
						Mix.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add the spices for the burgers
							(red pepper flakes, thyme, black pepper, chili powder, salt).
						Mix.
					</li>
					<li>
						On a hot pan, cook the burgers for about 5 minutes on each side.
						To form the batter into burgers,
							scoop out the desired amount with eg a pasta stirrer,
							pack it together a bit,
							place it on the hot pan,
							and press it together with a metal spatula.
						If the pan is not yet hot, it may take more than 5 minutes on the first side.
						If stove is too hot, it may take less time, so make sure not to burn the burgers!
					</li>
					<li>
						Flipping the burgers can be challenging, especially if the plantains were too dry or the batter doesn't have enough eggs.
						Using a second spatula can be a big help.
					</li>
					<li>
						While the burgers are cooking on the second side, toast the burger buns if desired.
					</li>
						Place cheese slices on the burgers a couple minutes before they finish cooking if desired.
					</li>
					<li>
						Serve the burgers on buns topped with cheese, the sweet potato fries, pickles, ketchup or BBQ sauce, and other toppings as desired.
						Enjoy!
					</li>
